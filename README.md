# Create FF

Create Friendly Fire is a modpack mostly focused around the Create mod, but it also contains lots of nature and other technical mods adapted to work well with Create.

This modpack is heavily inspired by [Create 90gQ](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/create-90gq), which is a modpack for minecraft 1.18.2 that we've shamelessly stolen some recipes and the CC: Tweaked texture pack from.
